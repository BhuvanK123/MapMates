# 🗺️ MapMates

**MapMates** is a lightweight geography puzzle game built with Flutter. It was inspired by the popular game **GeoConnections**, which challenges players to make clever links between countries, cities, and regions. I liked the concept—but wanted to create a simpler, beginner-friendly version focused just on matching countries by continent.

This is my prototype: a clean, minimal game where you tap four countries that belong to the same continent. It’s a fun way to sharpen your geography skills and explore how puzzle logic works in Flutter. Planning on adding more features in future updates.
